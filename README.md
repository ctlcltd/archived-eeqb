If you are looking for a ready-to-use Python channel editor, you could try this one: https://github.com/DYefremov/DemonEditor.

I started this project starting from code of my remote controller here: https://github.com/ctlcltd/remote-gx-ir.

*At the moment it supports enigma lamedb version 4 only.*

My goal is obtain an almost fast editor, scriptable, to handle channel lists.
